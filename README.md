## Lognormal-Field Based Inference on Weak Lensing Convergence Maps with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains the code used in my master's thesis, titled 'Lognormal-Field Based Inference on Weak Lensing Convergence Maps with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks' (see Masterarbeit.pdf). The code has been refactored and enriched with comments for better readability and educational purposes.
The repository is organized into four subdirectories, each corresponding to different aspects of the thesis:

1. **Theory_and_Basics**: This subdirectory covers the content of chapters 2, 3, 4, and 6 of my thesis. It delves into the background theory behind my research, statistics in the cosmic density field, basics of observational cosmology, the theory of weak gravitational lensing, and neural networks. Here, I provide essential tools for observational cosmology, such as the Boltzmann Solver(Class) and Healpy.

2. **Lognormal_Simulation**: Chapter 5 of my thesis is mirrored in this subdirectory, which focuses on the simulation pipeline. It's where I generate training, validation, and test datasets for training Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs).

3. **GCNN_Inference**: Corresponding to chapter 7 of my thesis, this subdirectory covers data preprocessing and the training steps for my GCNN networks.

4. **Result**: In this subdirectory, I present the results of my analysis. It includes the plots not only from Chapter 8 but also from Appendices B and C.

Feel free to explore each subdirectory for a deeper understanding of the code and its alignment with my master's thesis.
