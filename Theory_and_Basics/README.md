## Section 1: Theory and Basics

Before delving into Yugioh, it's essential to understand the rules thoroughly(But I didn't, when I played it as a child). In this section, we revisit the fundamental components of my duel deck!

1. **Introduction1_Python.ipynb:** This notebook covers the basics of Python and explores various statistical distributions(actually only two!).

2. **Introduction2_Healpy.ipynb:** Learn how to visualize sky data(CMB!) and calculate the angular power spectrum. We use Planck data as an example.

3. **Introduction3_CLASS.ipynb:** Understand how to calculate various types of power spectra using the Boltzmann solver(analytically, see this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0303072).

4. **Introduction4_TensorFlow.ipynb:** Get familiar with the basics of TensorFlow.

5. **Introduction5_Keras.ipynb:** Dive into a more practical problem, "Boston Housing Price," we should apply to Novogarchinsk.

6. **Introduction6_CNN.ipynb:** Explore MNIST images, on future, test it with Hebrew alphabet characters (some are parity twins)!

7. **Introduction7_DeepSphere.ipynb:** This notebook provides a simplified version of the inference part of my thesis.
